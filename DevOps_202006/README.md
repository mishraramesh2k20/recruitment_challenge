# DevOps/Data Engineer Challenge
This challenge will test your understanding and ability to combine and use some of the technologies
we are using in our systems

## Task
Build a flask server with the following pages:
* Index page
* Uploader page where you can upload a file SMALLER THAN 1MB to an 
api

The API is hosted at https://patw1h5276.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/beta/upload and accepts 
POST requests only at the specified URL.

The server must manage checking the file size and only send it if it's smaller than 1MB.

## Hints

Flask: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/

## Deliverable

A flask server that can send files to the API 
 

## Good luck and we are very excited to see your solutions! 
The next step in the interview process is then a personal meeting at our office.

## Note: We don't expect you to build THE perfect solution.
Our goal here is:
* See how you approach such a problem
* Get an idea of your programming skills and tools you can use


from flask import Flask,render_template,request

app = flask(__name__)
app.config['MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH'] > 1 * 1024 * 1024
@app.route('/')

def index():

  return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/upload',methods=['GET','POST'])

def upload():
 file = request.files['inputFile'])
 return file.filename

if __name__ == '__main__':
  app.run(debug=True)
